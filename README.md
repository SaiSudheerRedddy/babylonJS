BABYLONJS 

babylonJS is a javascript library which helps to create 3D rendering on a web application. 
Please follow the steps from the documentation to setup babylonJS on your project. 
Try commenting out the codes to see rendering different objects. 

What have I tried out in this code :
- Create different objects
- Create different camera
- Create different textures for the meterials of the object
- Transform the objects
- GeoMetric Transformation of the object.
